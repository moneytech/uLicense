# Rationale

Shortest license I could make up that features:
- Shortest clause compatible with Public Domain, Unlicense and CC0 intentions (+ no attribution required): from 0BSD license.
- Shortest "No warranties + Dont held liable" legal text: from ZLIB license.
- If both sections are orthogonal and DFSG/FSF/OSI/GPL compliant, this license *should* be DFSG/FSF/OSI/GPL compliant too.
