# Rationale
- Universal donors, universal recipients. No attribution required. No Warranty. Dont held liable.
- Shortest free clause (from BSD license) + Shortest legal text (from ZLIB license). If both sections are orthogonal and OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible, this license *should* be OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible as well.
