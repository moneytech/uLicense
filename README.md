# Rationale
- Shortest free clause (from Zero-BSD license: "Public Domain/Unlicense/CC0 intentions + no attribution required").
- Shortest legal text (from ZLIB license: "No Warranty + Dont held liable").
- If both sections are orthogonal and OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible, this license *should* be OSI/FSF/GPL/DFSG compatible as well.
